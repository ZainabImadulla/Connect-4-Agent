Note: When running the program on a Windows computer, the Minimax vs. Minimax and Minimax vs. Random game modes may experience some lag, potentially causing the window to display a "Not Responding" message. Please do not close the window; the results will appear on the board after a brief loading period. These game modes run smoothly on Mac computers without any issues.
